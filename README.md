**As a nature spirit you can…**

    Plant trees and generate rocks that the civilization will use as resources to expand and develop technology. Beware that resources too far are hard to reach. They last longers but produce less.
    Spawn animals the civlization will use for foood. This is the only resource you can’t live with, specially early on, keep a good track of it.
    Change the temperature. It affects many things. Highger temperatures makes people consume less food. Lower temperatures increase food consumption but reduce population multiplication, and also diseases effectivity.
    Unsleash diseases. These will help you to control the population when overpopulation occurs. The more cells used by the civilization, the more the population can increase without falling into overpopulation.

**The civilization will rise and expand**

    Expansions occur when some criterias are met and allows the civilization to have more population.
    Age advance occur when some criterias are met and completely changes how your civilization behaves in terms on consumption and productionm, while also changing how diseases affect them.

**To win and lose**

    To win you’ll need to reach the modern stage of civilization by the year 100.
    You’ll lose if pollution consumes you or if you fail to keep the civilization alive.

*I’m aware of some calculations bugs. Yet didn’t have the time to correct them properly, so it will make the game a little more challenging to win*
